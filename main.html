	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution even for large inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of its input size. For example, an algorithm with <b>Space Complexity</b> O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input size.</p>
