	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. As a programmer my goal is reducing time complexity and make it more efficient.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of its input size. For example, space complexity of an algorithm  uses memory that grows linearly with the input size of n is O(n).</p>
